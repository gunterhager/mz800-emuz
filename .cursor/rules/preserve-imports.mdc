    message: |
      DO NOT modify import statements unless explicitly requested by the user.
      
      Common mistakes to avoid:
      1. Changing import paths
      2. Adding new imports
      3. Removing existing imports
      4. Changing import aliases
      
      If the user's request requires import changes:
      1. Ask the user explicitly about modifying imports
      2. Wait for confirmation before making any changes
      3. Only make the specific import changes requested

examples:
  - input: |
      const std = @import("std");
      const foo = @import("foo").bar;
      
      // Code changes requested...
    output: |
      // Keep imports exactly as they were
      const std = @import("std");
      const foo = @import("foo").bar;
      
      // Make requested code changes...
